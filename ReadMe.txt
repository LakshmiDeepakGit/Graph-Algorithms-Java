Program Execution

Extract the Zip file provided by me in project submission and open the AlgoDs_Project2 folder, where we have src file

Copy the path of the directory where we have src folder

Open command prompt and change the directory to the path which you have copied
Now Compile all the java files from our package present inside the src folder 
javac AlgoDS/Project2/*.java

After compiling the code, Run the main.java class which is starting point of our code flow
java -cp bin AlgoDS.Project2.Main.java

Now it will ask for the path of input txt file which needs to be run. Give the path accordingly and you will get output
Enter input file path (e.g., inputs/dfs1.txt)
Refer screenshot(provided in document) if needed while executing the code in terminal
